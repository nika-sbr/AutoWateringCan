# AutoWateringCan
This is an Arduino project that monitors soil moisture levels using a sensor and activates a pump to water the plants when the soil is too dry. Moisture levels are displayed on an LCD screen along with emoji indicating the condition of the plants. The moisture levels are also printed over the Serial interface for remote monitoring.
